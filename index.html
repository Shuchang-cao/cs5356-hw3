It allows the background color and text color to change gradually, instead of instantly, which leads to a more engaging user experience.

<!--
  I use <details> as the HTML element we haven't talked about. I discovered that using the <details> element is like having a built-in show/hide button that makes extra content available only when needed. It works right out of the box—clicking the <summary> toggles everything neatly, and it handles keyboard and screen reader interactions automatically, which is pretty awesome for keeping things accessible without extra hassle

    I use transitions as a CSS property we haven't talked about in detail. I've learned that using CSS transitions for menu and button highlighting creates a smooth and visually appealing effect when a user hovers over an item. It allows the background color and text color to change gradually, instead of instantly, which leads to a more engaging user experience.
    I also use transform as a CSS property we haven't talked about in detail. I learned that the transform property can modify an element’s position and size, rotation without affecting its surrounding layout. It provides a way to create animations, like scaling elements with smooth transitions.
